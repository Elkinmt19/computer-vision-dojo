This repository was created to learn and gain new knowledge about computer vision and all its possible applications in the field of robotics and smart systems. <br>  
## SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES :computer:
### PYTHON DEPENDENCIES
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) <br>
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.  

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) <br>
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) <br>
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) <br>
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

### C++ DEPENDENCIES
* [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) <br>
The Microsoft C++ Build Tools provides MSVC toolsets via a scriptable, standalone installer without Visual Studio. Recommended if you build C++ libraries and applications targeting Windows from the command-line (e.g. as part of your continuous integration workflow). Includes tools shipped in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9, and all major updates to Visual Studio 2019 (v16.x). 
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) <br>
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) <br>
CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
